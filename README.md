# Adaline-Noise-Elimination
A program is implemented to remove certain noise from a signal. These noises usually have a periodic behavior. For example, the noise generated by the fan cooler.
In this method, the system takes the noise from its source of production and with the help of the adaline network predicts how the noise reaches the listener. Therefore, by applying the opposite phase to the ambient signal, the effect of noise in the environment is eliminated.
